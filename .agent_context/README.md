# Agent Context Directory

This directory contains the context, plans, and logs for the AI Agent developing this application. It serves as a persistent memory bank for future agents picking up the task.

## Contents
- **`task.md`**: The master task list and progress tracker. Check this first to see what is done and what is pending.
- **`implementation_plan.md`**: The working design document for current and upcoming features.
- **`walkthrough.md`**: A log of debugging sessions, resolved issues, and implementation details.

## Instructions for Future Agents
1.  **Read `task.md`** to understand the current priority.
2.  **Read `implementation_plan.md`** to understand the agreed-upon architecture and design.
3.  **Update these files** as you progress. If you change the plan, update the plan file. If you complete a task, check it off in `task.md`.
